  <p>Seaview is a luxury 38ft x 12ft, fully serviced, with three separate bedrooms.  There is one double room with en suite toilet and two twin rooms with single beds.  There is a family shower room and the option of a pull out double sofa bed in the lounge.</p>
  <p>The modern kitchen has a fridge freezer, cooker and cupboards with convenient work tops. The lounge and dining areas have modern furniture and there is also a small flat screen TV.</p>
  <p>Double glazing and Calor Gas central heating make this new mobile home a cosy option for cooler days.  Cooker and hot water are run on Calor Gas and there is an electric heater in the lounge.</p>
  <p>The caravan will have duvets as well as pillows and blankets; but as is customary with caravans, in the interest of hygiene, our customers are asked to bring their own linen and duvet covers.</p>
